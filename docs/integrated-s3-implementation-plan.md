# Integrated S3 Implementation Plan

Build a modular, AOT-conscious ASP.NET storage platform that exposes an S3-compatible HTTP surface, supports pluggable backends (`S3`, disk, future providers), uses `ClaimsPrincipal`-driven authorization, and ships as reusable NuGet packages. The recommended approach is to separate protocol compatibility, storage orchestration, provider implementations, and ASP.NET integration so the system can grow toward broad S3 parity without becoming tightly coupled or hard to optimize.

## Current Implementation Status (March 2026)

The repository has already moved beyond initial scaffolding and now contains a working vertical slice.

### Important current architectural decision

`IntegratedS3.Core` should remain **persistence-agnostic by default**. Applications that want catalog/metadata persistence can either:

- register their own `IStorageCatalogStore`, or
- opt into the extracted `IntegratedS3.EntityFramework` package by supplying their own `DbContext` type through a generic registration such as `AddEntityFrameworkStorageCatalog<TDbContext>(...)`

That keeps Core from owning an internal application database model or forcing a specific provider such as SQLite into every consumer.

Another important architectural decision now in place is that service/provider descriptors and reported capabilities should come from registered backends/Core rather than from sample-host manual composition. `IntegratedS3Options` still provides fallback metadata for bootstrap-only scenarios, but the default runtime path now reflects actual backend registrations.

Another important architectural decision now in place is that authorization is separated from orchestration. `IStorageService` resolves to an authorizing decorator that wraps `OrchestratedStorageService`, which keeps bucket/key/version-aware authorization in Core without repeating authorization logic inside the orchestration implementation itself.

## Goals

- Ship as **NuGet packages**
- Provide **easy DI registration** and **easy endpoint mapping**
- Move toward **full S3-compatible behavior**
- Support **multiple storage backends**:
  - native S3
  - disk
  - future providers
- Allow **Blazor WebAssembly** and other frontends to work using standard auth flows and S3-compatible behavior
- Use `ClaimsPrincipal` for authz decisions in ASP.NET
- Make all important backend services **overrideable/configurable**
- Keep the entire stack **high-performance**, **streaming-first**, and **AOT/trimming aware**
- Expose efficient in-process services so consuming apps can directly access storage without HTTP overhead when desired

## Architecture Summary

The platform should be split into focused packages instead of building everything into the current `WebUi` project.

### Cross-cutting architecture to do — provider-native, externalized, and passthrough feature support

The current disk-provider sidecar approach is a valid **provider-specific emulation strategy**, but it should not become an implicit requirement for every future backend. The platform should stay viable for backends that:

- can only store raw object/blob content and need auxiliary state elsewhere
- can forward operations to an upstream S3-compatible API instead of re-owning behavior locally
- need hybrid composition such as “blob content upstream, metadata/state in a local catalog”
- may prefer redirect/delegation flows over proxy-streaming for downloads or uploads

This is especially important for potential future providers such as MediaFire-style integrations, redirect-heavy backends, and true S3 middleman/passthrough scenarios.

Detailed to do:

- **define auxiliary support-state ownership explicitly**

  - add a second backend-reported descriptor in addition to capability support status so the system can express where non-blob support state lives
  - this should answer questions such as:
    - does the backend itself own metadata persistence?
    - does IntegratedS3 own that state through a platform-managed database/catalog layer?
    - is the state delegated to an upstream system?
  - evaluate an enum/descriptor shape along the lines of:
    - `BackendOwned`
    - `PlatformManaged`
    - `Delegated`
    - `None` / `NotApplicable`
  - apply this concept to metadata, tags, checksums, version catalogs, multipart state, retention state, and redirect/location state rather than assuming a single storage strategy for all concerns
  - capability support should answer **whether** a feature exists, while this second descriptor should answer **who persists or resolves its support state**
  - for the target disk-provider architecture, object bytes live on disk but metadata and other auxiliary state should default to `PlatformManaged` rather than sidecar files

Status:

- support-state ownership descriptors now exist and can report `PlatformManaged` ownership independently from capability support
- the disk provider now uses that model for historical version/delete-marker metadata when an object-state store is registered
- current-object metadata and some other auxiliary state still retain transitional sidecar behavior and should continue moving toward platform-managed persistence

- **define provider modes explicitly**

  - document and support at least these provider shapes:
    - **managed provider**: IntegratedS3 owns most behavior and may emulate missing features locally
    - **delegating / passthrough provider**: IntegratedS3 forwards to an upstream S3-compatible or storage API with minimal local state
    - **hybrid provider**: object bytes live in one system while metadata, multipart state, tags, or version catalogs live in another
  - make sure provider mode is an explicit architectural concept rather than an accidental implementation detail

- **keep raw storage transport separate from auxiliary feature state**

  - avoid assuming every `IStorageBackend` can or should persist arbitrary extra metadata next to the object
  - do not require local providers such as the disk backend to own metadata persistence just because they own object bytes
  - prefer an architecture where the backend focuses on bucket/object transport and a separate platform-managed persistence layer stores auxiliary state
  - treat the following as potentially externalized concerns rather than mandatory backend-owned concerns:
    - object metadata persistence
    - object tags
    - checksum persistence and validation metadata
    - version chains / logical versions
    - multipart upload state and cleanup metadata
    - redirect/location indirection data
  - preserve the rule that provider contracts should model what the backend naturally owns, not every feature the platform may emulate around it

- **introduce optional support-service abstractions for non-native features**

  - evaluate dedicated abstractions/services for capabilities that may be provider-native, externalized, or unsupported, for example:
    - metadata store / metadata resolver
    - multipart state store
    - version catalog store
    - tag store
    - checksum store / validator
    - redirect or object-location resolver
  - make the platform-managed database layer the default composition point for these services in managed deployments instead of assuming filesystem sidecars in each provider
  - design the disk provider specifically so it can store bytes only while metadata, tags, versions, multipart state, and checksums are persisted through these support services
  - ensure these services are optional and overrideable through DI
  - keep `IntegratedS3.Core` persistence-agnostic while still allowing composition with EF, custom databases, caches, or provider-native implementations

- **clarify capability reporting beyond simple local emulation**

  - revisit whether `native | emulated | unsupported` is expressive enough for long-term provider diversity
  - keep capability support and support-state ownership as separate concepts so a feature can be reported as `emulated` while its state ownership is `PlatformManaged`
  - evaluate whether the system needs additional semantics such as:
    - delegated
    - externalized
    - proxied
  - if the capability enum should remain small, add another descriptor surface that explains *how* a capability is fulfilled and where its support state lives without breaking current compatibility reporting
  - document clearly that disk sidecars are only one emulation technique, not the canonical expectation for all providers

- **design a first-class passthrough / middleman mode**

  - support the scenario where IntegratedS3 acts primarily as:
    - an authorization gateway
    - a compatibility layer
    - a request-signing / request-validation boundary
    - a proxy or redirector to another S3-compatible API
  - minimize unnecessary local persistence in this mode
  - allow large transfers to remain streaming-first and avoid forced buffering unless the protocol truly requires it
  - preserve room for request forwarding, upstream resigning, response passthrough, and selective header translation

- **model object access outcomes more flexibly than “always return a stream”**

  - evaluate whether object reads/downloads should be able to produce:
    - a local/proxied stream
    - a redirect result
    - a delegated presigned URL
    - an upstream passthrough response shape
  - do the same evaluation for upload initiation flows where direct-to-provider upload may be preferable to proxying through ASP.NET
  - keep the HTTP surface compatible while allowing richer in-process orchestration decisions

- **ensure future provider implementations are not blocked by local-sidecar assumptions**

  - add tests and design checks for providers that cannot write arbitrary sidecar files or auxiliary metadata next to the blob
  - add tests and design checks for providers that intentionally persist all metadata in the platform-managed database layer while the backend stores only object bytes
  - validate at least one future-oriented scenario such as:
    - upstream S3 passthrough provider
    - remote blob provider with external metadata catalog
    - redirect/delegated-download provider
  - make sure these scenarios can be implemented without forcing fake local filesystem semantics

- **treat disk sidecars as an implementation choice, not a platform law**

  - treat the current sidecar approach as transitional, not as the target architecture
  - the intended end state for the disk provider is that disk stores object bytes and the database/support-state layer stores metadata, tags, checksums, version chains, and multipart tracking
  - avoid letting any temporary sidecar/index implementation leak upward into shared abstractions or orchestration assumptions
  - whenever a new shared contract is introduced, explicitly ask whether it requires backend-owned persistence or can be satisfied through composition

- **sequence this work alongside the next capability slices**

  - versioning, tags, and checksums should still be the next major capability slice
  - but while doing that work, validate that the new contracts can support:
    - native implementations
    - externalized support-state implementations
    - delegated/passthrough implementations
  - use the disk provider as the first proof point for `PlatformManaged` support-state ownership instead of adding more sidecar-backed metadata behavior there
  - do not bake disk-specific persistence assumptions into the new versioning/tag/checksum APIs

## Phase 0 — Solution and Package Foundation

1. Restructure the solution under `src/IntegratedS3/` into modular projects.
2. Keep dependencies one-directional: providers depend on abstractions/protocol; optional integration packages (such as EF Core persistence) depend on Core, not the other way around; ASP.NET integration depends on abstractions/protocol/core; sample apps depend on packages, not the other way around.
3. Keep the existing `WebUi` as the first sample/reference host.
4. Define public API boundaries early: public extension methods, public options types, public service abstractions, and internal implementation details.
5. Freeze naming conventions and namespaces before implementation expands.

## Phase 1 — Canonical Storage Contract

Define a backend-agnostic storage contract that supports S3-level semantics while still allowing non-S3 backends.

### Core abstractions

- bucket operations
- object CRUD
- metadata
- tags
- checksums
- versions
- conditional requests
- range reads
- multipart upload lifecycle
- copy/move semantics
- retention/legal hold descriptors
- encryption descriptors
- capability discovery

### Auxiliary support-state ownership

Capability support alone is not enough. The system also needs a separate backend-reported descriptor that explains where non-blob support state is owned or resolved.

Recommended direction:

- keep capability status focused on `native | emulated | unsupported`
- add a second enum/descriptor for support-state ownership, with a shape such as:
  - `BackendOwned`
  - `PlatformManaged`
  - `Delegated`
  - `None` / `NotApplicable`
- allow this descriptor to apply per concern or per capability slice rather than only once for the entire backend
- use it to drive orchestration and persistence composition for:
  - metadata
  - tags
  - checksums
  - version chains
  - multipart state
  - retention/legal-hold state
  - redirect/object-location state

The desired disk-provider direction is explicit: the disk backend should store raw object bytes, while metadata and other auxiliary state should live in the platform-managed database/catalog layer.

### Required design rules

- no provider-specific SDK types should leak into public contracts
- all storage operations must be async and streaming-capable
- unsupported features must be explicit through capability reporting, not hidden or silently degraded
- backend contracts must not require providers to persist auxiliary metadata or other support state when that state can be externalized through platform services
- error behavior must be normalized

### Canonical error model

Create a stable error/result model for:

- object not found
- bucket not found
- access denied
- invalid range
- precondition failed
- version conflict
- bucket already exists
- multipart conflict
- throttling
- provider unavailable
- unsupported capability
- quota exceeded

## Phase 2 — Define “Full S3 Support” as Capability Slices

“Full support” should not be treated as a single checkbox. It needs a capability matrix and milestone tracking.

### Capability slices

- bucket create/delete/list/head
- object get/put/delete/head
- object metadata and headers
- list objects semantics
- pagination/continuation tokens
- range requests
- conditional requests
- multipart uploads
- copy operations
- presigned URLs
- object tags
- versioning
- batch delete
- ACL and policy-related behavior
- CORS behavior
- object lock / legal hold / retention
- server-side encryption variants
- checksum support
- XML-compatible S3 error responses
- path-style and virtual-hosted-style addressing

### Per-backend support status

For each feature, every backend should declare one of:

- native
- emulated
- unsupported

### Per-backend support-state ownership

For metadata-bearing or emulated features, every backend should also declare where the auxiliary support state lives:

- `BackendOwned`
- `PlatformManaged`
- `Delegated`
- `None` / `NotApplicable`

This second descriptor is especially important for local and passthrough providers, because it prevents the architecture from assuming that `emulated` automatically means `persisted by the storage driver itself`.

Examples:

- disk provider: object bytes may be backend-owned on disk while metadata/tags/versioning/checksum state is `PlatformManaged`
- S3 passthrough provider: support state may be `Delegated` to the upstream S3-compatible system
- custom website/blob provider: object transport may be backend-owned while metadata is either `PlatformManaged` or `Delegated` depending on integration shape

### Disk backend emulation needs

The disk provider will likely need externally managed catalog/state support — database-backed by default — for:

- ETags
- metadata
- tags
- version chains
- retention state
- ACL-equivalent descriptors
- checksum persistence

### Current capability matrix snapshot

The project now has enough implemented surface area that the capability slices can be tracked concretely instead of only aspirationally.

| Capability slice | Core / abstractions | Disk backend | ASP.NET / S3 surface | Automated coverage | Current notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| object get/put/delete/head | implemented | native | implemented | yes | supports streaming request/response flows |

| SigV4 presigned-query validation | implemented | n/a | implemented | yes | request validation exists even though first-party presign generation does not |
| first-party presign generation | not started | unsupported | not exposed | no | next step belongs in client/core surface design, not only protocol helpers |

| object tags | partially implemented | emulated | implemented | yes | direct contracts and S3-compatible `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE ?tagging` now cover current and archived object versions on the currently supported surface, including version-id-aware delete-tagging parity; broader tagging edge cases and continued persistence cleanup are still pending |
| versioning | implemented for the current vertical slice | emulated with platform-managed historical catalogs | implemented for the current supported surface | yes | current object versions receive persisted opaque version IDs, overwrites archive historical versions, `versionId` read/head/delete/tagging/copy-source flows can target archived versions, `GET` / `PUT ?versioning` round-trip through Core/disk/HTTP, `GET ?versions` now lists historical versions and delete markers, and version-enabled deletes now create S3-compatible delete markers while historical metadata can be platform-managed |
| checksums | partially implemented | emulated | partially implemented | yes | disk now computes and persists checksums for the current put/copy/multipart flows, preserves them through platform-managed object state, validates direct put-object SHA-256 plus CRC32 request headers, and supports checksum-enabled multipart SHA-256 initiate/upload-part/complete parity including per-part checksum echoes plus composite completion checksum/type exposure; broader algorithm coverage and deeper header edge cases are still pending |
| ACL / policy behavior | not started | unsupported | not implemented | no | authorization is `ClaimsPrincipal`-driven rather than S3 ACL compatible today |
| CORS | not started | unsupported | not implemented | no | expected to land later as explicit HTTP integration work |
| object lock / retention / legal hold | not started | unsupported | not implemented | no | needs both abstractions and provider persistence shape |
| server-side encryption variants | not started | unsupported | not implemented | no | should remain capability-driven rather than implied |

This matrix should now be treated as the authoritative status view for the current vertical slice and updated alongside each meaningful feature increment.

## Phase 3 — Multi-Backend Orchestration and Backup Support

Support for “different storage backups” requires a proper orchestration layer, not just multiple registrations.

### Orchestration responsibilities

- primary storage selection
- mirrored write execution
- read routing
- health-aware provider choice
- failover policy
- replication/reconciliation tracking
- checksum comparison
- orphan cleanup

### Consistency modes

Recommended supported modes:

- `PrimaryOnly`
- `WriteThroughAll`
- `WriteToPrimaryAsyncReplicas`
- `ReadPreferPrimary`
- `ReadPreferHealthyReplica`

### Backup semantics to define clearly

Document what “backup” means in each topology:

- synchronous mirror
- asynchronous replica
- archive target
- cold backup
- read replica

### Failure semantics to specify up front

- primary succeeds, backup fails
- backup succeeds, primary fails
- metadata diverges
- object content diverges
- replica is stale
- provider is unhealthy
- reconciliation cannot complete

Without these rules, multi-backend support becomes operational chaos.

Status:

- multiple registered backends are now supported by the Core orchestration path
- `PrimaryOnly` and `WriteThroughAll` are implemented as the first concrete consistency modes
- write-through mirroring currently covers bucket create/delete, object put/delete, and copy-object behavior
- read routing now supports `PrimaryOnly`, `PreferPrimary`, and `PreferHealthyReplica`
- backend health can now be injected through `IStorageBackendHealthEvaluator` so unhealthy providers can be deprioritized without coupling providers to a specific health framework
- health-aware reads, asynchronous replicas, reconciliation, and divergence repair are still pending

## Phase 4 — ASP.NET Integration and Developer Ergonomics

The consuming developer experience should be excellent.

### DI registration API

Provide a top-level extension:

- `AddIntegratedS3(...)`

Status:

- initial `AddIntegratedS3(...)` is implemented
- `AddIntegratedS3Core(...)` is implemented for orchestration without forcing EF registration
- EF-backed catalog persistence is available through the extracted `IntegratedS3.EntityFramework` package and a dedicated generic registration against a consumer-owned `DbContext`
- catalog model mapping is exposed through `modelBuilder.MapIntegratedS3Catalog()` so consumers can keep the schema inside their own EF model
- critical persistence services are overrideable via DI today through `IStorageCatalogStore`

Support overloads for:

- configuration binding
- inline configuration
- named providers
- manual provider registration
- advanced service overrides

For the EF integration, the intended consumer flow is:

- register the application `DbContext`
- call `AddIntegratedS3Core(...)`
- call `AddEntityFrameworkStorageCatalog<TDbContext>(...)`
- map the catalog entities from `OnModelCreating(...)` via `modelBuilder.MapIntegratedS3Catalog()`

### Endpoint mapping API

Provide endpoint mapping like:

- `MapIntegratedS3Endpoints(...)`

Status:

- initial endpoint mapping is implemented for service, bucket, and object operations
- object endpoints now include pagination, range requests, conditional GET/HEAD support, and copy-object behavior via `PUT` with `x-amz-copy-source`
- S3-compatible multipart initiate/upload-part/complete/abort routing is implemented on the current object surface
- S3-compatible current-version object tagging is implemented through `GET` / `PUT ?tagging`
- `versionId` handling is implemented for the currently supported object read/head/delete and tagging routes, and copy-source parsing now honors `versionId` for archived-version source reads as well
- current object responses now emit `x-amz-version-id`, direct put-object requests can validate `x-amz-checksum-sha256` / `x-amz-checksum-crc32`, and bucket routes now support S3-compatible `GET` / `PUT ?versioning`
- S3-compatible root/bucket/object routing is implemented alongside the JSON convenience endpoints for the currently supported operations
- AWS Signature Version 4 request validation is implemented for authorization-header and presigned-query requests, though first-party presign generation APIs are still pending
- SigV4-compatible `aws-chunked` request bodies are decoded for the currently supported write flows, including multipart part upload
- batch delete and S3-compatible XML list responses are implemented for the supported bucket-level routes, including delimiter/common-prefix and `start-after` handling on the `list-type=2` surface
- authenticated ASP.NET requests now flow `HttpContext.User` into Core authorization evaluation
- feature-group toggles are not implemented yet

Allow feature-group toggles such as:

- service endpoints
- bucket endpoints
- object endpoints
- multipart endpoints
- admin endpoints

### Overrideability requirements

All important services should be replaceable via DI:

- authorization evaluator
- provider factory
- metadata index
- checksum calculator
- mirror coordinator
- presign strategy
- clock
- tenant resolver
- object naming policy
- stream pool
- request authenticator
- XML response writer
- hosted reconciliation services

### Hosting requirements

The ASP.NET integration must work with:

- Minimal APIs
- `CreateSlimBuilder`
- trimming
- AOT
- OpenAPI where practical

The default sample host should avoid opting into EF automatically so the baseline hosting path stays clean for trimming/AOT validation.

## Phase 5 — Authentication and ClaimsPrincipal Authorization

Authentication should remain normal ASP.NET authentication. Authorization should be storage-aware.

### Auth flow

1. ASP.NET authentication creates a `ClaimsPrincipal`
2. storage operations pass through a storage authorization service
3. authz resolves:
   - allowed operation
   - bucket access
   - key prefix access
   - tenant scope
   - version access
   - quotas/policies

### Recommended authz abstraction

Use a dedicated service such as:

- `IIntegratedS3AuthorizationService`

Status:

- `IIntegratedS3AuthorizationService` is implemented
- `IIntegratedS3RequestContextAccessor` is implemented so ASP.NET can flow the current `ClaimsPrincipal` into Core
- authorization currently executes in an `IStorageService` decorator (`AuthorizingStorageService`) over `OrchestratedStorageService`
- coarse endpoint-level authorization policies are still optional and not wired as first-class route-group configuration yet

This service should receive:

- principal
- operation intent
- bucket
- key
- version
- metadata intent
- request context

### Browser/WASM support model

Preferred design:

- **presigned URL hybrid**

That means:

- frontend authenticates to ASP.NET
- backend authorizes with `ClaimsPrincipal`
- backend returns presigned upload/download URLs when allowed
- frontend talks directly to storage for large transfers

Also support:

- pure proxy mode when direct storage access is not allowed

## Phase 6 — S3-Compatible Endpoint Surface

If standard S3 clients should work, the server must behave like an S3-compatible endpoint surface, not just expose “storage-ish” REST routes.

### Endpoint areas

- service-level operations
- bucket-level operations
- object-level operations
- multipart lifecycle
- utility/admin endpoints
- presign support

### Required protocol fidelity

- canonical request parsing
- signature handling
- signed header processing
- query-signed requests
- proper header behavior
- ETag fidelity
- XML error responses
- continuation token behavior
- delete batch response behavior
- multipart completion document compatibility
- conditional request status mapping
- range request handling

Status:

- path-style service, bucket, and object routing is implemented
- virtual-hosted-style bucket/object routing is implemented for compatible requests when enabled via configuration
- range request handling is implemented for disk-backed `GET` object operations
- conditional request status mapping is partially implemented for `GET`/`HEAD` via ETag and HTTP-date validators
- continuation-token pagination is implemented for both the JSON convenience endpoint (custom continuation header) and the S3-compatible `list-type=2` XML bucket-listing route
- S3-compatible `ListObjectsV2` now supports delimiter/common-prefix and `start-after` semantics for the currently supported surface area
- multipart upload initiate/upload-part/complete/abort behavior is implemented across the current abstractions, disk backend, XML request/response models, and S3-compatible HTTP object routes
- object tagging is implemented across the current abstractions, disk backend, XML request/response models, and S3-compatible HTTP object routes for current and archived versions on the supported surface
- historical object-addressing is now implemented for the currently supported `versionId` object/tagging/delete flows, with `x-amz-version-id` emitted on current and archived object responses
- bucket-level versioning controls are implemented for the currently supported `GET` / `PUT ?versioning` route surface
- copy-object behavior is implemented through `PUT` plus `x-amz-copy-source`, and the HTTP surface now returns an S3-style XML `CopyObjectResult`
- batch delete is implemented through `POST ?delete`, and the HTTP surface now returns an S3-style XML `DeleteResult`
- S3-style XML error responses are now returned for storage endpoint failures
- SigV4 authorization-header and presigned-query request authentication are implemented for the currently supported surface area, and SigV4-compatible `aws-chunked` request decoding now supports current write flows including multipart part upload
- direct put-object requests now validate SHA-256 checksum headers on the current supported surface area and map mismatches to S3-style `BadDigest` responses

### Current protocol fidelity gaps worth prioritizing

The current HTTP surface is real and useful, but it still has some clearly bounded fidelity gaps that should be treated as deliberate backlog rather than invisible debt:

- multipart upload support currently covers the core initiate/upload-part/complete/abort workflow, but broader parity such as multipart listing/discovery semantics and richer edge-case hardening is still pending
- object tagging now covers current and archived object versions on the currently supported surface, including S3-compatible delete-tagging; broader S3 tagging edge-case behavior is still pending
- only the currently supported bucket subresources are implemented; unsupported S3 bucket/object subresources intentionally return `NotImplemented`
- S3-compatible bucket listing now covers both `list-type=2` and the current `?versions` subresource, while additional subresource combinations are still pending
- conditional behavior is solid for the current `GET` / `HEAD` paths, but broader S3 precedence and edge-case parity still need hardening
- SigV4 validation and `aws-chunked` decoding work for the implemented routing surface, but canonical-request edge cases and parity hardening should continue before claiming wider compatibility
- first-party presign generation is not yet exposed even though presigned request validation is implemented

### Addressing strategy

Recommended milestone approach:

- path-style routing first
- virtual-hosted-style support later as an explicit milestone

## Phase 7 — Provider Implementation Order

### 1. Disk provider first

Build `IntegratedS3.Provider.Disk` first to validate:

- abstraction quality
- metadata/index strategy
- versioning model
- atomic file writes
- streaming
- error translation
- reconciliation logic locally

Status:

- this milestone is still in progress, but the current versioning slice is substantially broader
- current disk backend validates the basic abstraction shape, streaming CRUD, metadata sidecars, local orchestration/catalog persistence, paginated listing, range reads, conditional requests, copy-object behavior, multipart upload lifecycle handling, bucket versioning controls, historical object version access/tagging/deletion, list-object-versions behavior, delete-marker creation/promotion, and direct put-object checksum request validation
- historical version and delete-marker metadata can now be composed through platform-managed object-state/catalog persistence, while some current-object metadata paths still remain transitional sidecar-backed behavior
- retention, broader indexing, and remaining checksum parity work are still pending

### 2. Native S3 provider second

Build `IntegratedS3.Provider.S3` next:

- use native S3 APIs
- preserve streaming semantics
- translate provider errors to canonical storage errors
- support presign generation
- preserve metadata/version/checksum semantics as much as possible

### 3. Future providers later

Potential future providers:

- Azure Blob
- Google Cloud Storage
- Cloudflare R2
- MinIO-specific tuning

## Phase 8 — Direct In-Process Developer Access

The platform should register efficient services so app developers can directly use storage without HTTP overhead.

### In-process service goals

- direct upload/download/list APIs
- provider-agnostic contract
- efficient streaming
- optional authz hooks
- metadata/tag/version support
- mirror-aware behavior when needed

### First-party client package

`IntegratedS3.Client` should support:

- typed calls to the ASP.NET endpoint surface
- auth token forwarding
- streaming upload/download
- presign helpers
- Blazor-friendly usage patterns

## Phase 9 — Performance and Optimization

Performance must be designed in from the start.

### Performance rules

- streaming-first I/O
- avoid large memory buffering
- source-generated serialization where possible
- minimize allocations in hot paths
- span-based parsing in signature/header handling
- pool buffers
- avoid reflection-heavy activation
- keep provider SDK details internal
- optimize range and multipart paths specifically

### Hot paths to benchmark

- request auth/signature validation
- metadata lookup
- object upload
- object download
- multipart part upload/complete
- mirrored writes
- list operations
- presign generation

### Metrics to track

- throughput
- p50/p95/p99 latency
- allocations
- LOH pressure
- temp file churn
- thread-pool pressure
- provider latency breakdown

## Phase 10 — Reconciliation, Health, and Observability

### Optional hosted/background services

- mirror replay
- orphan detection
- checksum verification
- provider health probes
- multipart cleanup
- index compaction
- expired temporary artifact cleanup

### Observability requirements

- structured logs
- metrics
- traces
- correlation IDs
- provider tags
- auth failure visibility
- mirror lag visibility
- reconciliation backlog visibility
- health endpoints

## Phase 11 — Testing, Conformance, and Packaging

### Test layers

- unit tests for contracts and policies
- provider tests for disk and S3
- integration tests for ASP.NET endpoints
- conformance tests for S3-like behavior
- fault-injection tests for backup/mirroring
- trimming/AOT publish tests
- benchmark regressions

Status:

- unit tests exist
- disk-provider tests exist
- ASP.NET integration tests exist
- Core orchestration tests exist
- pagination/range/conditional/copy/multipart/tagging behavior is covered in automated tests today
- AWS SDK compatibility coverage now includes virtual-hosted-style CRUD/list plus host-style presigned URL, multipart upload, and copy/conditional flows
- initial fault-injection coverage now exists for mirrored-write replica failures in Core orchestration tests
- S3 conformance, broader fault-injection coverage, trimming/AOT publish verification, and benchmark automation are still pending

### Consumer validation

Ship sample apps for:

- Minimal API
- MVC/Razor
- Blazor WebAssembly

### Packaging goals

- clean XML docs
- sensible package dependencies
- optional integrations such as EF Core should stay in dedicated packages so consumers do not pay for them implicitly
- analyzers/diagnostics if helpful
- versioned protocol compatibility
- easy onboarding docs

- persisted checksum metadata is now implemented for the current disk/Core/HTTP object lifecycle paths, including platform-managed object-state composition, SHA-256 response header exposure, direct put-object request-side SHA-256 plus CRC32 validation, and checksum-enabled multipart SHA-256 initiate/upload-part/complete parity with composite completion checksums
- AWS SDK and S3-compatible HTTP coverage now round-trip the current supported multipart checksum slice, including per-part checksum echoes plus `ChecksumType` / `x-amz-checksum-type` exposure for composite completions
- version-id scaffolding is now in place for current object versions across disk/Core/catalog/HTTP, bucket-level versioning controls round-trip through Core/disk/HTTP, the disk/HTTP surface supports archived-version access, tagging, delete-tagging, deletion, copy-source reads, list-object-versions, and S3-compatible delete markers, and historical version/delete-marker metadata can now flow through platform-managed catalog/object-state persistence; continued movement of current-object auxiliary metadata off sidecars, broader checksum algorithm coverage, and remaining advanced versioning/tagging edge cases are still pending

## Verification Checklist

1. Ensure package dependencies are acyclic.
2. Ensure `IntegratedS3.Core` remains persistence-agnostic and does not require EF Core packages.
3. Ensure `IntegratedS3.AspNetCore` can be consumed without forcing all provider SDKs into every app.
4. Ensure optional integrations such as `IntegratedS3.EntityFramework` are only brought in when explicitly referenced by the consumer.
5. Publish a trimmed/AOT sample host and verify startup and endpoint behavior.
6. Validate S3-compatible request handling with conformance cases covering signing (authorization header and presigned query), XML list and batch-delete responses, virtual-hosted-style addressing, multipart, range, conditional requests, and XML errors.
7. Verify parity behavior between disk and S3 providers.
8. Run failure tests for backup/mirroring behavior.
9. Benchmark critical paths and track regression baselines.
10. Verify service overrideability via DI in tests.
11. Validate end-to-end behavior with a Minimal API sample, an MVC/Razor sample, and a Blazor WebAssembly sample.

## Key Decisions

- **Package shape:** modular packages first
- **Preferred browser model:** presigned URL hybrid
- **Goal:** broad S3-compatible endpoint support tracked through milestones
- **Important boundary:** “full support” must be represented by a capability matrix
- **Provider implementation order:** disk first, native S3 second
- **Current `WebUi` role:** sample/reference host, not final architecture container

## Recommended Next Execution Slice

The most pragmatic next step is now to build on the newly landed **multipart checksum parity, delete-tagging, and platform-managed historical catalog** slice by continuing the migration of auxiliary metadata away from provider-local sidecars and hardening the remaining versioning/tagging edge cases on the current supported surface.

Why this should come next:

- the supported multipart checksum slice is now coherent across Core, disk, HTTP, XML, and AWS SDK compatibility tests, so the biggest remaining fidelity gaps have shifted toward persistence cleanup and the rest of the tagging/version lifecycle
- historical version/delete-marker state and multipart checksum state now have provider-agnostic platform-managed seams, which makes this a good moment to keep moving current-object metadata, tags, and checksums in the same architectural direction
- remaining non-current-version/tagging edge cases plus auxiliary-state persistence cleanup are now the clearest user-visible and architectural gaps on the supported surface
- after the auxiliary-state path is less sidecar-centric, reconciliation/health work and advanced subresources can build on a more even provider model

Recommended implementation sequence:

1. continue moving disk-provider current-object metadata, tags, and checksum persistence from sidecars toward platform-managed support-state services by default
2. add more conformance-style tests around version pagination markers, remaining non-current-version/tagging edge cases, and checksum/header fidelity
3. document the extracted EF integration pattern further with migrations guidance and consumer-owned model examples for metadata/tag/checksum state evolution
4. extend backend health from static evaluation into active probes, health snapshots, and richer read failover semantics once the object-fidelity surface is less sidecar-centric
5. after that slice lands, choose between reconciliation semantics for divergent replicas or the next set of advanced S3-compatible bucket and object subresources

## Suggested Next Step

Given the current implementation state, the next recommended step should be:

1. continue moving the disk-provider metadata path toward platform-managed database persistence for current-object metadata, tags, checksums, and other auxiliary support state
2. add more conformance-style coverage for version pagination markers, remaining non-current-version/tagging cases, and checksum/header fidelity
3. extend backend health from static evaluation into active probes, health snapshots, and richer read failover semantics once the object-fidelity surface is less sidecar-centric
4. document the extracted EF integration pattern further with migrations guidance and consumer-owned model examples, including metadata/tag/version/checksum state evolution
5. introduce reconciliation semantics for stale or divergent replicas after the auxiliary-state migration is clearer
